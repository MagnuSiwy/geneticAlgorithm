# Genetic Algorithm to solve the task assignment problem

The algorithm was written during the Erasmus exchange. It is an advanced genetic algorithm with the crossover function and elitism selection to get the best solution possible. Additionally, in this solution doubled entries in the new population are eliminated. The children returned by the crossover function have to be unique.
